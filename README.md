Dataset Details :<br>
Size: 8.3 GB<br>
Number of instances: 11,000,000 (Eleven Million)<br>
The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first 21 features (columns 2-22)
are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last seven
features are functions of the first 21 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists
to help discriminate between the two classes.<br>
